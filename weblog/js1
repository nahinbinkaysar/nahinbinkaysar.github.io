#1	
In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between <script> and </script> tags.

```<script>
	document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "My First JavaScript";
</script>```

You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document.

Scripts can be placed in the <body>, or in the <head> section of an HTML page, or in both.
