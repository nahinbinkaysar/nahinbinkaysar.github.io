# Can't win in life, can I?

One of the Schrödinger's Box in my life was chocolate. At most 6 hours ago, she unfriended me. I got to know this using the Social Fixer Extension. We have not stayed in touch since April. I texted; she didn’t reply. I never dared to text again. Now this happened.
After all these years have passed, I still feel terrible. No words spoken. Silent goodbyes are the worst. It is fatally worse if the person involved is her.
