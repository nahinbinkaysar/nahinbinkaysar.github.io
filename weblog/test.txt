### MathJax
When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
	
	\[x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.\]

Here is an example of some inline math: \(E = mc^2\)

And here is a block-level math equation:

$$\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$$

You can also use LaTeX commands for more complex expressions:

$$\frac{a}{b} + \sqrt{c}$$
