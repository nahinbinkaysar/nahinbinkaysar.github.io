# Good Byes are the worst!

We had our time. And in the end the birds should go to their nests. Good byes are always hurtful. I should be in solace, thinking the moments chose us in the time of crisis. Crisis will rule out the impure.

As the country heals, this life boat will take me to the unknown. Lots of people to befriend. Lots of palces to conquer. Please hold off this feeling till the next good bye.

From me to you: dear me.
