I am losing my precious possession

For some days, I couldn't code regularly. The reasons being the pressure imposed by the department. Today was a div 3 contest. I had a feeling, that I shouldn't participate in this. But I did anyways and failed miserably. I could only solve A, B.

It took me so long to reach pupil. After today I will again be grey.
