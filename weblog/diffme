A thought has been bouncing off my head for a couple of months. It is that, I become a different person in different places. For example, I just searched LTT on youtube to see a video about macbook air m4. normally on Dhaka i would never watch certain youtube channels - no matter what. At tangail, there is a sudden urge to watch those channels. I don't know why i am like this. there are some other significant behavarial changes that i often notice. The gravity of the change is weird.
