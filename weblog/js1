#1	
In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between script tag

```<script>
	document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "My First JavaScript";
</script>```

You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document.

Scripts can be placed in the <body>, or in the <head> section of an HTML page, or in both.

Scripts can also be placed in external files.
```<script src="myScript.js"></script>```

### Using innerHTML
To access an HTML element, you can use the \(document.getElementById(id)\) method. Use the id attribute to identify the HTML element. Then use the innerHTML property to change the HTML content of the HTML element:

```<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Web Page</h1>
<p>My First Paragraph</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "<h2>Hello World</h2>";
</script>

</body>
</html>```

### Using innerText
Use the \(innerText\) property to change the inner text of the HTML element:

```document.getElementById("demo").innerText = "Hello World";```

#...

let a, b, c;  // Declare 3 variables
a = 5;        // Assign the value 5 to a
b = 6;        // Assign the value 6 to b
c = a + b;    // Assign the sum of a and b to c

a = 5; b = 6; c = a + b;

let person = "Nahin";
let person="Nahin";

"John" + " " + "Doe"

Single line comments start with \(//\)

#...
### Comment
Multi-line comments start with \(/* and\ with */\)

var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var z = x + y;

### Variable re re

Note
The var keyword was used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.

The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.

The var keyword should only be used in code written for older browsers.

When to Use var, let, or const?
1. Always declare variables
2. Always use const if the value should not be changed
3. Always use const if the type should not be changed (Arrays and Objects)
4. Only use let if you can't use const
5. Only use var if you MUST support old browsers.

Variables declared with let have Block Scope
Variables declared with let must be Declared before use
Variables declared with let cannot be Redeclared in the same scope

  let x = 2;
}
// x can NOT be used here

var x = 10;
// Here x is 10

{
var x = 2;
// Here x is 2
}

// Here x is 2

let x = 10;
// Here x is 10

{
let x = 2;
// Here x is 2
}

// Here x is 10


let and const have block scope.
let and const can not be redeclared.
let and const must be declared before use.
let and const does not bind to this.
let and const are not hoisted.

var does not have to be declared.

var is hoisted.

var binds to this.

var x = 2;
// Now x is 2

var x = 3;
// Now x is 3



JavaScript const variables must be assigned a value when they are declared:

const PI;
PI = 3.14159265359;

// You can create a constant array:
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

// You can change an element:
cars[0] = "Toyota";

// You can add an element:
cars.push("Audi");

const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

cars = ["Toyota", "Volvo", "Audi"];    // ERROR


// You can create a const object:
const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};

// You can change a property:
car.color = "red";

// You can add a property:
car.owner = "Johnson";

var x = 2;     // Allowed
var x = 3;     // Allowed
x = 4;         // Allowed


### Hoisting re re

Variables defined with var are hoisted to the top and can be initialized at any time.
