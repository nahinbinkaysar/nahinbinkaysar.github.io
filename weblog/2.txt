Things got ended with her about a month ago. I wanted always her as a friend. I don't think there will be any conversation between us going forward.
I am imagining it will be hurtful to me in the coming days. Love is not fully there. I only want to maintain a good interaction. But for that I feel now, she won't talk to me. I know this as she came here for documents, saw me. She ignored the whole time.

I am only writing for these reasons:
1. Ongoing exam
2. https://youtu.be/8UVNT4wvIGY
3. A comment from this video

This song really hits me bad
Before pandemic, me and my friend (she) were very close to each other. We shared the same classroom. We use to have fun in between the free lectures or some occasion. I started to feel that she really have the feelings towards me so did I have. One day my friend, sneaked into her diary, and found out that yes!! She really did have the feelings towards me. He only told that she likes me and nothing else. Till date, I don't even know what was actually written in her diary. But I was toooo shy and uncomfortable to tell her the same. That was the last day of my school before pandemic. That's been 3 years from now(approx.). Though she still in my school, but we haven't even talked with each other since couple of years. She literally ignores me everytime we have n eye contact. That really hurts man. Now you're just somebody that I used to know
