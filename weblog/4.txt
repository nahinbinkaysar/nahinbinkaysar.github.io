I took a long break from developing this weblog system. This might be because the lack of motivation on doing so. I have proper time in hand now to pull somthing off like this and I am trying to do by this early morning of 30 June. Hang on a moment, is today DMS's birthday? *(see? /cryptic Do you know him?)* I knew the date was before Harry Potter's birthday. Let's check...

Harry's on the end of July. Regardless I sent DMS a wish.

What I was saying: I wanted to rebuild the weblog system from the ground up. A few months ago *(probably a year)* I started this project. Previous system was not standard. Idea was to hide the links from the address bar. It was successful. I used browser memory to do store a id when the user clicked a blog. It was a lame application.

This system starts on a json file. That file lists all the weblog files. I will later expand the json file's strength by adding some meta-information regarding individual blogs.
Then the text file will contain a markdown-like content. I made a parser. This parser will parse text to some custom conditions I made. I already added some md elements. A good advantage is I can make newline with ease. No need to enter the escape character. It has a link functionality. I have been listening to this for a while now: [Shinunoga E-Wa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zh9Wb1KuW8).

I just found out I can directly use any **HTML TAG!!!!!!**
<p> This is a paragraph </p>
<div style="width:100px; height:100px; background-color: tomato;"> This is a div!!!!</div>

Let's try an embed:

<iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EoVQ_TQFJy0" title="Djo - End of Beginning (Official Lyric Video)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Ofcourse it should work. Why wouldn't it? It is good to become and surprised and happy at the same time nowawdays.

Well, after that, there are some javascripts and htmls. Bye for now, need to fix the cssssss.
