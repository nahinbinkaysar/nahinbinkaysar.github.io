Tomorrow will mark 1 month of my ownership of a mac. I have been only using the mac. With occasionally using my windows on class and for tution. In these days, I haven't really used my windows a lot.

My experience on mac was a rollercoaster ride. In the first few days I couldn't use it much - due to the survey course. For the next few days, I didn't like it all. Everything felt out of place. The software seemed very primitive. They lacked the control I have on windows.

External hardware also sucked. My favorite mouse couldn't be used properly on that. I couldn't even transfer files over USB among my android and the mac.

The next few days, I liked the mac a bit more. The battery life is good. The build quality is good. The display is good. The touchpad was good. The keyboard was okay.

People like macbooks keyboard a lot. But to me, I feel very much comfortable writing on my asus, like I am doing right now. The command, option and control keys seemed out of order. The keyboard shortcuts doesn't make much sense to me.

The outlook towards the keyboard hasn't changed. Typing on asus still feels great.

Mac is not built for multitasking in any sorts. I haven't used any two apps side by side. It is not feasible on mac. The window snapping feels very out of place.

People use mac for serious stuffs. I don't know how people can. I think people that do more serious stuffs aren't on mac, they are on windows and for more and more serious stuffs they are on windows or Linux.

Mac does not feel capable to me. I sometimes think I would go back to a windows machine soon. I mean, my whole life was spent on windows. How could I think of making this switch? What thing was I on when I decided this?
